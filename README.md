**Biomes O' Plenty** is a **Minecraft mod** that adds **over 50 new biomes** to the overworld and Nether. From coral reefs to bamboo forests, all of our biomes are decorated with a slew of **new plants, trees, flowers, and more!**

-----------------

**Note:** To use the mod on a **server**, you must set the **level-type** setting in your server's config file to **BIOMESOP**

If you want to **disable or add certain world generation features** in certain biomes, check out our guide for creating **biome configuration files**: https://github.com/Glitchfiend/BiomesOPlenty/wiki/Configuring-Biomes
